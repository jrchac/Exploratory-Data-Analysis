**1. About the Project:**

Summary of the project objectives and questions to be investigated.
Identification of relevant datasets from Fitbit.
Proposal of research questions related to activity, calorie burn, exercise duration, and sleep duration.

**2. Data Exploration and Statistics:**
Selection of datasets for analysis including daily activity, daily calories, daily intensities, daily steps, hourly steps, and sleep day.
Proposed research questions including analysis of activity levels during different hours of the day and days of the week, the relationship between steps and calorie burn, the impact of exercise duration on calorie burn, exercise duration on sleep duration, and exercise duration on time spent in bed without sleeping.
Detailed statistical analysis including scatter plots, correlation coefficients, and p-values to answer each research question.

**3. Machine Learning Models:**
Investigation of how being active affects participants' sleep duration.
Pre-processing steps including merging datasets, dropping irrelevant features, and dividing data into categories.
Selection of relevant predictors and target variables.
Building and evaluation of regression models including Linear Regression, SGDRegressor, Lasso, and Ridge.
Analysis of coefficients of determination (R^2) and root mean squared error (RMSE) to evaluate model performance.

**4. Discussion:**
Evaluation of data quality and consistency.
Suggestions for improvements including increasing sample size, ensuring data consistency, and implementing experimental manipulations for causal inference.
Overall, the report presents a comprehensive analysis of Fitbit data to investigate the relationship between activity levels and various health metrics such as calorie burn, exercise duration, and sleep duration. It provides insights into statistical findings and suggests areas for further research and improvements in data collection and analysis.
